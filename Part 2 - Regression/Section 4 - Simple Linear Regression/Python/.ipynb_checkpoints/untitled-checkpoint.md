## Assumptions af linear regression
- Lung Function = Bo+b1(age)+e
- lineaarity 
    - The data shuld be linear with data and the value
    - As in real it should not be linear
- Constant Error Varience (Homoscedasticity)
    - This Homoscasticity implies that the distance( Varience ) between linear line and the X should be same throughout the regression line
- Independent Error Terms
    - The errors should be independent thoughout the regression
- Normal Errors
    - Nomally distruibuted rrors ( The data should be normally distributed)
- No multi Collinearity
    - 
- Exogeneity
    - it refers to the variable biase ( it baised to one variable always )\
